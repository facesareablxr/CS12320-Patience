This was my first year programming project - I received 84% overall in this, I would have achieved more if I worked on the GUI. 
I may add this in at some point later on to develop it further. 

Task:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My friend Chris developed a form of patience (solitaire) card game that I would like to be
able to play on my computer. It is very simple, runs from command line but has a basic
graphical interface. This is how it works:
• The object of the game is to end up with one pile/stack of cards.
• Shuffle a deck of cards.
• Lay down the first card face up.
• Lay down the next one next to it, and so on.
• This would lead you to 52 cards all facing upwards, except that you can put one pile
on another if any of the following apply:
o They are next to each other and the same number or suit.
o There are two piles between them, and they are the same number or suit.

Overall Comments:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
An excellent solution of the assignment. Very good solution where implemented functions worked properly. You have provided good attention to details in the report.
You could have achieved a few more marks if you implemented JavaFX. I was very impressed with the Command Line Design and the options you have provided
were quite user friendly. As a whole, a very good submission. Well done!
